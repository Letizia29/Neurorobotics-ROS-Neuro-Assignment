# Neurorobotics-ROS-Neuro-Assignment
Implement a processing chain in ROS-Neuro to determine when the logarithmic band power of the EEG signal crosses a given threshold.

Both group members contributed equally to the project, but focusing on different aspects. Letizia's contributions was mainly about the thresholding node implementation, while Valentino focused on the bandpower code implementation.
